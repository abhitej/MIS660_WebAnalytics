Team,

I create a GIT repository.

Who ever donâ€™t have account please create an account at github.com


Fork my  repository (https://github.com/uyarabha/MIS660_WebAnalytics.git), so that  you will all the code into your account as well


I copied all our python files to repository, not the text files, when ever we want we can push text files to repository.


As number of files growing , maintaining google drive might become tough , so better to start GIT as professor suggested.

Let me know if you need any help.


set upstream URL : https://github.com/uyarabha/MIS660_WebAnalytics.git

set origin URL : https://github.com/<your username>/MIS660_WebAnalytics.git
